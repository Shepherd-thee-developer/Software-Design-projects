Student Management System
==========================

This is a simple student management system that allows you to add, delete, update, and view student information.

How to Run the System
--------------------

1. Save the `student_management_system.py` file to a directory on your computer.
2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where you saved the file.
3. Run the system by typing `python student_management_system.py`.
4. Follow the menu prompts to add, delete, update, or view student information.

Changes Made
------------

* Refactored the code to follow SOLID principles.
* Eliminated redundancy and simplified the design.
* Implemented a menu system for user interaction.
* Added comments to explain key sections of the code.

Note: This system is a simple console-based application and does not persist data. If you want to persist data, you will need to add a database or file storage mechanism.
